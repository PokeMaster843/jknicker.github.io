# Demo Site

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Purpose of Site

This site was created partially to expand my coding repertoire, and partially to demonstrate my ability to learn new technologies quickly.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (content/interactive elements)
- Vue/Vite (web framework)
- CSS/SCSS (page styling)
- HTML
- Git/Github (source control)
- Github Pages (site deployment)

### JavaScript

This is the main language used for the site's content and interactive elements.

### Vue/Vite

This is the web framework the site was built in.
