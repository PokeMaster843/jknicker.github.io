# Demo Site

Welcome to my demo site! Well, welcome to my demo site's Github repository! Feel free to look at the code, or take a peek through the rest of this README!

## Purpose of Site

This site was created partially to expand my coding repertoire, and partially to demonstrate my ability to learn new technologies quickly.

## Technologies Used

- [JavaScript](#javascript) (content/interactive elements)
- [Vue/Vite](#vuevite) (web framework)
- [CSS/SCSS](#cssscss) (page styling)
- [HTML](#html)
- [Git/Github](#gitgithub) (source control)
- [Github Pages](#github-pages) (site deployment)

### JavaScript

As I have much more experience with JavaScript than other languages like TypeScript (and I did not wish to learn too much all at once), I chose to use it for this site's content and interactive elements. In previous personal projects, I had only ever used `var` declarations, but with this project I decided to try and scope my variables better by using mostly `const` and `let` declarations.

### Vue/Vite

Having little experience working with web frameworks, I opted for one that appealed to me on a personal level. The structure and syntax were very appealing, and I saw this framework mentioned in the requirements of several web development internships I was looking at.

### CSS/SCSS

Being somewhat particular about maintaining visually pleasing/well-structured code, I shyed away from CSS due to its structure for a long time, instead often cluttering my HTML files or JavaScript files with styling when necessary. At the start of this project, I was determined to finally learn CSS, but I quickly discovered the wonderful extension that is SCSS. Being able to scope things, use variables/functions, and import other stylesheets made the design process much easier, especially when troubleshooting or experimenting.

### HTML

Through the creation of this site, if nothing else I have learned this one thing: `<div>` elements are incredibly useful for keeping everything contained and separating what needs to be separate.

### Git/Github

Having never collaborated with others on projects to a large enough degree to warrant source control like Git, I had no prior experience with this. However, since it is an incredibly useful skill to know, and I had the time to start learning, I decided to use it with this project and familiarize myself with the basic commands.

### Github Pages

Having only ever run code locally, I was unfamiliar with how to go about deploying my site so that others could also view it. Since I was already using Git/Github for source control, I opted to use Github Pages for my site. I found it somewhat confusing, but I expect that is mainly due to inexperience seeing as how I only started attempting to deploy to Github Pages after developing the site to a "presentable" state.
